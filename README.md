Rotten Potatoes
git pull
As an anime viewer, I want to find new animated shows/ movies to watch , so that I can be up to date on the latest media.

I also want to be able to rate the shows and movies for myself.


- What was your motivation? 

We love being able to see how the professionals rate shows/movies but we wanted to make one just for regular people to have as well. I want a site to access and rate animes I've watched and watch them again. 

We ran out of time, but future enhancements would be the ability for the user to add their own content to differenciate us from them

* improve user experience 
* Slideshow of anime shows when log in
* Search option
* Trending/popular this week
* Picture on Account Page (avtar/ profile picture)
* ability to add your own content, using the css already there
* Stars changed to Potatoes
* Logo




- What problem does it solve?

it allows the user to rate and watch their favorite anime shows.


- What did you learn?
we were able to use what we learned from the class and with the help of other resources, we learned how to get buttons to redirect correctly, drop down menu's, alert messages to work and a working modal
